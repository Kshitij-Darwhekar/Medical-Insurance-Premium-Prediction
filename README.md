# Medical-Insurance-Premium-Prediction

1. Introduction                                                                                                                                                             
  The goal of this project is to help people in predicting the amount a person will pay as a premium according to thier health status. Health insurance is a necessity     nowadays, but due to various factors like age, gender, whether person smokes or not, number of childrens etc. it is very hard to predict the price of insurance premium   that's why I choose this project.
